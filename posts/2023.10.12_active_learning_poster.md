Have you ever heard about *Active Learning* in the context of *Machine Learning*? Well, I hadn't until I started my Master's thesis. In this post, you can find a poster I presented in UPNA's Artificial Intelligence Week 2023, where I explain what *Active Learning* is and how you can use it.

> You're more than welcome to come see me present it on October 18th (2023) at 17:00 in the *Open Space* of *Public University of Navarre*'s library. I'll also answer any questions you may have!

You can find the poster in the image below, and click it for the full-size poster in PDF format.

In the introduction, you can get an idea of what Active Learning is and what scenarios it can be applied to. Then, I introduce the different methods that I chose to implement and compare when researching the state of the art. The next two sections are dedicated to presenting the experimental setup and experimental study I carried out. Finally, I present the conclusions I reached after the study and some future lines of work.

I hope you found the poster interesting and both concise and informative! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or check out the [video](/blog/my-bsc-thesis-on-active-learning-explained-in-3-minutes.html) where I explained my thesis in 3 minutes (in Spanish).
