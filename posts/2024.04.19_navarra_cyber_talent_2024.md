It's been a challenging week in two ways: not only figuratively, as I've been working on my Master's Thesis while attending uni and working, but also literally, since I took part in the Navarra Cyber Talent CTF competition within #OTDChallenge2024.

I teamed up with my colleagues Imanol and Jorge, and we ended up in the first spot! The competition's goal was to solve nine capture-the-flag-like challenges in groups and I found it truly thrilling. We couldn't take our eyes off hackrocks' live scoreboard and managed to achieve the most points among all participants.

I would like to congratulate all of them, as well as the event organizers, and our professors from UPNA for their support and guidance while preparing for the challenge.
