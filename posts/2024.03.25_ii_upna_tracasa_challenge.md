After [my participation last year](/blog/i-upna-tracasa-ai-challenge), this week I took part in the second edition of the UPNA-Tracasa AI challenge. This time, I teamed up with my colleagues Jorge and Imanol, and we managed to win the second spot, really close to the first one! I'm already looking forward to the next edition; all good things come in threes, don't they?

The problem was quite different from last year's; instead of training an AI model, we faced a google-hashcode-like problem. We had to optimize the distribution of a set of crops over a given field in an optimal way to maximize an objective function. I found it very engaging and enriching, and noted the evolution from the previous edition, so I would like to congratulate the organizers for their amazing work.
