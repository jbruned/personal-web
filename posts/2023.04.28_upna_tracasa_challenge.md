Recently, I took part in an AI challenge with my colleagues Unai and IÃ±aki, and it was a pleasure. It was the first time I've participated in a challenge like this, but will definitely do it again! Although we had the best result in the first phase (25% of the test data), we ended up in the third spot with the remaining 75%. Congratulations to the rest of the winners and to the organizers for their amazing work!
