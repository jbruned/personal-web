Hello!

This is a brief post to let you know I'm trying out some new things and will publish something more interesting here soon!  
These last few days I've been renovating my personal website and I'm very happy with the results I'm getting.  
So far, I've made quite a few visual improvements and developed my very own deployment system. Now, every time I push to the `main` branch of the repo, the website is automatically updated.  
> You're more than welcome to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/jbruned/personal-web) while I continue to work on it.

You might notice that this is not the first post of the blog; that's because I've reshared some of my *LinkedIn* posts here to fill the website with some initial content.  
See you soon!
