Hello again!

Recently, I gave a talk (in Spanish) at the IV Meeting of Young Students in Sabiñánigo under the title "From classifying photos of Cats and Dogs to ChatGPT: What is Artificial Intelligence?".  
In it, I tried to explain the basics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for the general public, as well as some (incredibly) facinating applications of these technologies.

You can find the video recording of the talk below:

It was such a pleasure to be invited to participate in the event. The experience, although new for me, proved to be very enriching and I really enjoyed the talks of the other participants. I hope to be able to participate again in the future!

I hope you find the talk interesting!

Jorge
