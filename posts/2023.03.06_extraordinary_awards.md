Last thursday, UPNA's extraordinary awards were given to each degree's best academic record and it's a pleasure to announce that I was one of the recipients!

It was an honor to receive this recognition, and a pleasure to be able to meet some of my colleagues and have a chat with them. I would like to thank my family and my fellow students, as well as those professors who projected their thrill onto us and made us want to go a little further.
