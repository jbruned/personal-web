Hi there!

A couple of months ago I took part in the 3 Minute Thesis competition at the Public University of Navarre (BSc category).  
I did so with my BSc Thesis on "A review of Active Learning methods for classification problems". It was a new experience from which I definitely learnt a lot!

Recently, the video of my presentation was published on the university's YouTube channel and I thought it would be a good idea to share it here as well.  
Because of the nature of the contest, it's intended for the general public and barely contains any technical details.

I hope you find it interesting!
