Recently, I had the pleasure of being part of the master's graduation ceremony at Universidad PÃºblica de Navarra. This experience was particularly special for me, as I missed my own Bachelor's Degree graduation while on Erasmus. Being able to celebrate this milestone surrounded by my loved ones and colleagues, while witnessing all the effort pay off, was genuinely thrilling. What's next? Going all in with my Master's Thesis to culminate the hard work!
