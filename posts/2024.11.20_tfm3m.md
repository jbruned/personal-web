Hello!

It's been a while since my last post, but I'm back with some news! Last Thursday, I participated in the “In 3 Minutes” contest organized at the Public University of Navarre, where I presented my Master’s Thesis in —oh, surprise— 3 minutes.  
It's a fantastic opportunity to develop skills like speaking in public, which we sometimes overlook in technical fields. It was truly enriching, and I could see the evolution since I presented my Bachelor’s Thesis in 3 minutes just two years ago in the same peculiar format: with a very diverse audience and a very tight time limit.

You can watch the video of my presentation below (yes, it's in Spanish, sorry about that):

I hope you enjoyed the presentation and that I was able to channel my passion for computer vision and deep learning into a concise and engaging talk.  
To anyone reading this and considering participating in future editions, I can only recommend that you go for it without hesitation. You’ll learn a lot, and there’s absolutely nothing to lose!

Until next time,
Jorge
