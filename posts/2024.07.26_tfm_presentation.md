I am delighted to announce that last month, I presented my Master’s Thesis, “A Review of Instance Segmentation Models and Application for Identity Card Detection”. As the title suggests, it comprises both an academic component (an Object Detection & Instance Segmentation literature review) and an applied component (solving a real use case at Veridas with state-of-the-art models). After receiving a score of 10.0 out of 10, I can proudly say I’ve completed my Master’s Degree!

Like I did in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jorge-bruned_i-am-delighted-to-announce-that-last-month-activity-7221801286168375299-FG_7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), I would like to publicly thank Veridas for trusting me with this project and allowing me to grow both personally and professionally, along with my colleagues. The human quality there is simply unmatched and I look forward to continuing developing my career with them.

Stay tuned for more information on the thesis and its results!

Sincerely,
Jorge
